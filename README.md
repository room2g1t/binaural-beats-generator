# binaural-beats-generator
 
Binaural beat therapy is an emerging form of sound wave therapy. It makes use of the fact that the right and left ear each receive a slightly different frequency tone, yet the brain perceives these as a single tone‚Äù. For example, if the left ear registers a tone at 180Hz and the right ear registers a tone at 190Hz, the binaural tone beat is the difference between the two different frequencies - 10Hz.
I made two amplitude modulated oscillators and panned them to left and right, user can choose different waveforms and change the volume and pitch by using the slider.
